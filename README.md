# Plotly-challenge

This project implements three types of plots to illustrate the biodiversity that lives in several subject's navels.   The code reads the data captured in a json file to filter and organize for display several variables.

Throughout the development process console.log was used to verify the acquisition of the data in at the right point.  These console.log commands were later commented out so as to not overburden the processing of the analysis.

The main tasks were completed:
  - Extract the patients demographic metadata
  - Create a horizontal bar chart
  - Create a bubble chart

Additional tasks were completed:
  - Created a pie chart similar to the one in the sample images
  - Created a gauge chart to illustrate the frequency of navel cleaning by each subject
  - modified the referenced style css with an updated css file to customized the look of the page
